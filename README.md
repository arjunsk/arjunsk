### 👋 &nbsp; Hi, I am Arjun

#### &nbsp; 💻 I am Interested in 
- Storage Engines (LSM, BTree, Bitcask)
- Distributed Transaction (2PC, Paxos, RAFT)

#### &nbsp; 🍭 Recent projects I'm working on

- [tiny-lsm](https://github.com/arjunsk/tiny-lsm) - A simple LSM tree database with snapshot isolation support
- [matrixone](https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone) - A hyper-converged cloud native DBMS

#### 📋 &nbsp; Recent papers I've read
- [Spanner](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf) - Distributed Transaction using True Time

#### ✏️ &nbsp; Recent Blog posts
- [Build Tiny DB](https://medium.com/javarevisited/build-a-tiny-database-in-java-ca6d3f06e115) - Parser, Planner, Storage Engine, Calcite, ANTLR
- [Build Tiny Compiler](https://medium.com/javarevisited/build-a-tiny-compiler-in-java-662f67a1ce85) - Lexer, Parser, Semantic analysis, ASM Code Generation 
- [Spatial Partitioned RDD using KD Tree in Spark](https://medium.com/sys-base/spatial-partitioned-rdd-using-kd-tree-in-spark-102e0b53564b) - Spatial Partitioning, KD tree, Epsilon approximation

#### 📗 &nbsp; Featured Books
- [Patterns of Distributed Systems](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/) - Good for learning more about Spanner 2PC etc.
- [Algorithms and Data Structures for Massive Datasets](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Data-Structures-Massive-Datasets/dp/1617298034) - Great for learning about new data structures.
- [Database Design and Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/3030338355/) -  Great for understanding embedded Java databases like Apache Derby

#### ♟ &nbsp; Things I plan to work on
- Tiny LSM (Target July 21st)
- Skiplist
- AVL Tree
- Arena based Skiplist
- RB tree
- Interval RB Tree
- Radix Tree
- ART
- Bloom Filter
- LFU
- cuckoo hash
- Splay trees
